Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 📊

A high-performance, interactive educational tool built with C++ and SFML 3.0 to visualize how different sorting algorithms operate in real-time. This project was developed as a Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) End Term Project.

🚀 Features

5 Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Visualizes the "bubbling up" of largest elements.

Insertion Sort: Visualizes building a sorted array one item at a time.

Selection Sort: Visualizes finding the minimum element and placing it.

Quick Sort (Partition Sort): Visualizes the divide-and-conquer pivot strategy.

Merge Sort: Visualizes the recursive splitting and merging of arrays.

Custom Input: Users can input their own specific set of numbers to sort.

Real-time Visualization: Watch bars swap (Red), compare (Yellow), and lock into place (Green).

Interactive Controls:

Speed Control: Adjust animation speed dynamically (Speed + / Speed -).

Reset: Reverts the array to its original unsorted state.

New Array: Allows entering a fresh dataset without restarting the app.

Data Display: Values are displayed at the base of each bar for clarity.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++ (C++17 standard)

Graphics Library: SFML 3.0.2 (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

Build System: GNU Make (macOS) / MinGW g++ (Windows)

Platform: macOS & Windows

🍎 macOS Setup

Prerequisites

C++ Compiler: (e.g., g++ or clang++)

Homebrew: (Package manager for macOS)

SFML 3 & pkg-config:

brew install sfml pkg-config


Building & Running

Build:

make


Run:

open SortVisualizer.app


Clean (Optional):

make clean


🪟 Windows Setup

Running C++ with external libraries on Windows requires a bit more manual setup than macOS.

Prerequisites

MinGW-w64 (GCC Compiler): Install a compiler like MinGW-w64 (ensure g++ is in your system PATH).

SFML 3.0.2 (GCC MinGW version): Download the GCC MinGW 64-bit binaries from the SFML Website.

Installation Steps

Prepare SFML:

Extract the downloaded SFML folder (e.g., to C:\SFML-3.0.2).

Compile:

Open your terminal (PowerShell or CMD) in the project folder.

Run the following command (adjust the paths C:\SFML-3.0.2 to where you actually extracted SFML):

g++ -I C:\SFML-3.0.2\include -L C:\SFML-3.0.2\lib main.cpp -o SortVisualizer.exe -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system


Copy DLLs (Crucial Step):

Go to C:\SFML-3.0.2\bin.

Copy all .dll files (e.g., sfml-graphics-3.dll, openal32.dll, etc.).

Paste them into the same folder as your newly created SortVisualizer.exe.

Note: Without this step, the application will crash immediately upon opening.

Run:

.\SortVisualizer.exe


🎮 How to Use

Input Data: Upon launching, type a sequence of space-separated numbers (e.g., 50 100 25 75 10) and press Enter.

Select Algorithm: Click on any of the algorithm buttons (Bubble, Insertion, etc.) at the top.

Watch: The sorting process will begin immediately.

Yellow Bars: Elements currently being compared.

Red Bars: Elements being swapped or moved.

Green Bars: Default state.

Controls:

Speed +/-: Click to slow down or speed up the animation.

Reset: Click to restart the sort with the same numbers.

New Array: Click to go back to the input screen.

🧠 Algorithm Complexity Overview

Algorithm

Time (Avg)

Space

Description

Bubble Sort

$O(n^2)$

$O(1)$

Simple swapping of adjacent elements.

Insertion Sort

$O(n^2)$

$O(1)$

Efficient for small or nearly sorted lists.

Selection Sort

$O(n^2)$

$O(1)$

Minimizes the number of swaps.

Quick Sort

$O(n \log n)$

$O(\log n)$

Fast, divide-and-conquer strategy.

Merge Sort

$O(n \log n)$

$O(n)$

Stable sort, guarantees $O(n \log n)$ performance.
